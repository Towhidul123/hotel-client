                <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold text-center my-5'>Our History</h2>
                <p className='text-xl'>Founded in 1985 by the visionary hotelier, Robert "Bob" O'Connor, BOBO Motel started as a modest roadside inn with just 20 rooms. Bob's unwavering dedication to quality service and guest satisfaction quickly gained recognition, leading to the expansion and evolution of BOBO Motel into what it is today.
                <br />
                    Over the years, we have continued to grow, always guided by Bob's core belief that every guest deserves a warm, comfortable stay without breaking the bank. Today, BOBO Motel boasts a range of accommodations to suit various needs, from cozy single rooms to spacious family suites.</p>
